## ðŸ”Œ About Me

I'm a data analyst with a deep interest in energy markets, particularly how data can be used to improve energy security, reduce waste, and support the transition to a more sustainable future.

My work focuses on building business intelligence dashboards and analytics models that translate complex energy datasets into clear, actionable insights. Iâ€™ve worked with publicly available data from AEMO and other government platforms to create tools that track pipeline flow, production rates, and long-term trends in Australian energy infrastructure.

Through this repository, I aim to showcase real-world applications of data analytics in the energy sector from gas flow monitoring to cost modeling for infrastructure development. My long-term goal is to support smarter decision-making in Australia's energy and resource markets using modern data tools.

Whether you're a grid operator, analyst, or consultant, I hope this work helps inspire or support better energy outcomes.
